- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daran Thach.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytic platforms such as R/SAS/SQL/Python/Tableau. I apply analytics from operational and market standpoints to adequately describe, predict and attain actionable insights and to understand the customers/competition. I collaborate with staff and stakeholders to integrate and drive value from descriptive and predictive findings, merging data capabilities and performance metrics to drive growth.
