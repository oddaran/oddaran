- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daran Thach.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytic platforms such as R/SAS/SQL/Python/Tableau. I apply analytics of data from operational, business, governance standpoints to help my company describe, predict and attain actionable insights to understand its customers/competition. I collaborate with clients and stakeholders to integrate and communicate these descriptive and predictive findings, then merge data capabilities and performance metrics to drive growth.
- I strive to use practices that include using tools like version control systems, testing infrastructure, continuous integration tools, and a documented workflow like Rmarkdown docs.  For data analysts like myself, it's important to execute my work in a common server environment to software engineers.  Also, we should have a safety net that tracks the common environment, that capably manages the execution environment (i.e. "RENV" for R, and "VIRTUALENV" for Python).
